    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
      <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each
        addition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter
        into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly
        pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring
        to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
